            "text": "<p>We’re excited to welcome Liquid Earth back to Rhythm for a special night on December 12- a full-circle moment that traces back to our very first event in July 2024. His set helped define the energy and intention behind what Rhythm would become, so bringing him into the space again feels both natural and overdue.<br/><br/>The singular brand of house music that Liquid Earth crafts is unmistakable. Transatlantic at its core, weaving the rhythmic sensibilities of London and Berlin with the laid-back glow of his California roots. His sound sits at the intersection of eras: a touch of ’80s sleaze, the deepness of the ’90s, the wiggle of the early ’00s, all reimagined through state-of-the-art analog grooves. It’s dance music that feels both vintage and futuristic, built for club floors that want melody, texture, and movement.<br/><br/>Across releases on labels like Kalahari Oyster Cult, Voyage Recordings, and TerraFirm, he's carved out a lane that’s entirely his own. As a DJ, he moves with the same intention-effortlessly gliding from West Coast breaks to UK-leaning tech house, stitching together worlds with precision and a bit of cosmic mischief. His sets are known for their warmth, their punch, and their ability to keep a room locked in from the first bar to the last.<br/><br/>On December 12, we invite you to experience that energy up close in the intimate confines of Rhythm. Crisp, playful, groove-heavy, and undeniably Liquid Earth.<br/><br/>Joining him for an extended opening set, Ukraine-born and Toronto based DJ, producer, and label head: Olekhar.<br/><br/></p>",
