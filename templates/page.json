After a decade touring globally as Barely Legal, she stepped into a new era of production and curation, rebuilding her label Pretty Weird Records and doubling down on a sound that feels both unmistakably UK and strikingly contemporary.</p><p>Backed by the support of artists like Four Tet, Skrillex, Caribou, Bonobo, Ben UFO, Floating Points, and Bradley Zero, Chloé’s sets continue to push the boundaries of modern club culture. Welcoming her to Rhythm for a daytime session feels like the perfect way to close a weekend—light pouring in, energy high, and a world-class selector steering the room.<br/></p>",
